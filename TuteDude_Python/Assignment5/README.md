## 📝 Tasks Overview

### **Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks**
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a Python program that:
1. Creates a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values.  
2. Asks the user to input a student’s name.  
3. Retrieves and displays the corresponding marks.  
4. If the student’s name is not found, displays an appropriate message.  

**Expected Output Example:**

### **Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing**
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a Python program that:
1. Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.  
2. Extracts the first five elements from the list.  
3. Reverses these extracted elements.  
4. Prints both the extracted list and the reversed list.  

**Expected Output Example:**

Original List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

Extracted First 5 Elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Reversed Extracted List: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
